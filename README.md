Hi!
Thanks for checking my repostitory. I've had a problem with how Git and Github works and I'm still learning, but I will try to explain it here.
The "Projects" folder contains most of my Java projects. They are mostly connected with OOP and stuff like that.
The "Projekty 1" folder was a test, to check, if my eclipse environment was connected with Github. I might post smaller projects over there in the future.
The rest of my folders are connected with Spring, Html, Css and Js. I'm still trying to learn these.
I will probably edit this readme in the future.
